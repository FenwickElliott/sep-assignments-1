How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  Developers can only add elements to the back of the queue, but they can remove them
  from any position. They can also retrieve the element that exists at multiple locations
  or search for a particular person.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  A for loop is used to go through each index of the queue to see if the specific element exists.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  Any instance where people have to wait in a single file line, single lane traffic, synchronous
  function execution.
