How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  Developers can access the data by using the "at" method to retrieve the data at
  each pixel of the screen matrix. They can create a new pixel object with their
  desired color options and use the "insert" method to enter the pixel into the matrix.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  A nested for loop could be used to first find the pixel with a matching 'x' value,
  and then find the matching 'y' value in the second loop.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  A 2D array could be used to represent locations on a map, different rooms on each floor
  of a building, or basically anything with rows and columns.
